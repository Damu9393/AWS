Docker Swarm
Docker Swarm is a container orchestration tool for clustering and scheduling Docker containers. It allows IT administrators and developers to manage a cluster of Docker nodes as a single virtual system. With Swarm, multiple physical or virtual machines can be joined into a cluster.

Docker Swarm vs Kubernetes
Docker Swarm does not support autoscaling, whereas Kubernetes does.
Kubernetes Advantages
Large open-source community, backed by Google
Supports every operating system
Can manage large architectures and complex workloads
Automated with self-healing and automatic scaling
Built-in monitoring and wide range of integrations
Supported by major cloud providers: Google Cloud, Azure, and AWS
